My name is Jack Waters, I in a smaller town called Parkhill on main street. My favorite colour is purple and I tend to use it anywhere I can, weather it be in what I wear, accessories, personal projects, etc. I work at two locations, North middlesex arena and the local grocery store in my town. On top of that I have been helping our art gallery develop a better website, as well I have another request lined up for when I feel more confident. Some hobbies I try to partake in is gaming, streaming, art(specifically pixelart), and game design. I'm very exited to be in this class and I'm happy to see where I go from here.
